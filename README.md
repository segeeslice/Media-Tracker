# Media Tracker - Stop Forgetting your Friends' Recommendations!

An app for tracking any form of media that you want to get around to eventually,
with a strong focus on being simple, expandable, organizable, and accessible.

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS & npm
- Windows or Mac operating system

## Quick Start

Simply download the repo and run:

``` sh
npm install;
npm run start;
```

## Tech Stack

- At it's core, runs on [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- To interface with mobile OS, this interacts with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- To streamline development, this uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/)

Note that this wonderful tech stack wouldn't have been nearly as easy to
initiate without the help from the
[Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) boilerplate generator.

## Collaboration

While I'm not actively seeking out collaborators at this time, help is always
welcome! I'll be utilizing GitHub for issue tracking, albeit primarily for
organizational purposes. In any case, feel free to report issues or submit pull
requests, and I'll do my best to tend to them as fast as I can.
